# Hi, I'm Nikita 👋

I'm a **software developer based in Prague**, currently studying Informatics at the Czech University of Life Sciences. 

I've been working in IT since July 2020, initially as a technical writer for a company specializing in augmented reality for web browsers. However, during this time, I also gained a lot of programming experience and eventually transitioned to a full-time programming role.

My primary skills include 👨‍💻:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Three.js
- React.js
- Node.js
- Python
- MongoDB

Feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/shikitos) repositories for examples of my work, and don't hesitate to get in touch 📧!
